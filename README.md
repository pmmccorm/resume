Resume Tooling
==============

My previous resume was a .docx file carried from computer to computer via gmail.

The initial desire was to have a resume in markdown: easy to modify, human readable, easy to translate to PDF and html with pandoc.

There are lots of articles and github repos to do this. But I could not find anything that looks _slick_. Lots of entirely functional resumes PDF output but everything is so dry.

One route possible is to convert the markdown to html, then provide a stylesheet, then convert this html+css to a better looking PDF. This is a little better, but then I end up mucking with CSS+html and my target is the interim resume. It is awkward. Plus I hate CSS.

So this means I arrive at the Latex resume from a template: beautiful PDF output at the expense of having to deal with Latex.

If someone reads this and has found a better way please file an issue I would love to hear about it!
